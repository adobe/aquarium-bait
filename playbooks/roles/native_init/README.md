# Native init role

The role contains basic init scripts to run the nested image applications. The script is executed
on native environment started by Aquarium Fish or could be used as entry point to the environment.

It only can be used on unix platforms (as the Aquarium Bait itself) and doesn't support windows for
simplification of the scripts, but it can create native environment for windows on those platforms.

## Tasks

* Install init scripts
