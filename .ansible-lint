  # Disabled: "no-changed-when: Commands should not change things if nothing needs doing"
  # Reason: due to the known previous state of the VM - we can remove unnecessary if's and execute
  #         just a simple plain commands, that means we don't need to use the change management,
  #         but only the sequential steps execution without additional headache. So to remove the
  #         need of putting `changed_when: true` everywhere this rule was disabled.
  - no-changed-when

  # Disabled: "unnamed-task: All tasks should be named"
  # Reason: For simplification of playbooks it's not so bad to not give a name for some obvious tasks
  - unnamed-task

  # Disabled: "risky-file-permissions: File permissions unset or incorrect"
  # Reason: Default permissions is good enough for the most cases
  - risky-file-permissions

  # Disabled: "ignore-errors: Use failed_when and specify error conditions instead of using ignore_errors"
  # Reason: Ignore errors are really helpful with not so important operations
  - ignore-errors
