  # Disabled: "301 Commands should not change things if nothing needs doing"
  # Reason: due to the known previous state of the VM - we can remove unnecessary if's and execute
  #         just a simple plain commands, that means we don't need to use the change management,
  #         but only the sequential steps execution without additional headache. So to remove the
  #         need of putting `changed_when: true` everywhere this rule was disabled.
